This is a clone of AirBnB, made during my full-time bootcamp at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a>

It's built as a Rails 7 app, and utilizes PostgreSQL for DB management, Heroku for server hosting, Cloudinary API for image uploads, Devise for authorisation. It uses a combination of JS (Stimulus), SCSS, HTMl and Bootstrap for the front-end.

It's built by a team of 4, and allows users to rent out their own cars, or rent cars from other people, much like the well-known AirBnB.
